TODOS
=====
* Seperate the backend build of tgt-ttb with the actual build of Icarus
  Verilog. These two _should_ be able to build seperately, though some time
  will be required to figure out what we actually need.

	-> Done - Tim - 1/10/19

* Re-Write VCD parse so that we don't have to add the actual signals to the 
  verilog before simulation. VCD_parse.py should be able to figure that out on
  its own.

	-> Done?

* Factor in the conditional expressions in the always blocks
